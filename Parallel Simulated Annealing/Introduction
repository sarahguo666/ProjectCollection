This is an Independent Research aiming at PSA on Lennard Jones Problem

This folder include 2 graphs with different parameters and my presentation 

I run the C code on Supercomputer, download the result, and draw graphs using MATLAB
By obeserving the graph, changing the parameter to find the balance point and local minimum
Repeat the experiment for one parameter for 10  or 20 times
By changing the C code to control the parameter
