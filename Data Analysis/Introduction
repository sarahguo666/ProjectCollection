Thatâ€™s a team work, three people in a group.
The group will be given two sets of problems that require the use of statistical computation programs. 
The data in each project will be generated synthetically according to a model. 
The models are selected because they occur commonly, as noted in the scientific papers posted on the class blackboard. 

The first project will be to analyze two different sets of synthetic data using single predictor linear regression. 
One part of this problem will require to merge two data files; this part focuses on data processing issues. 

The second project will be to analyze synthetic data with multiple predictors and to report the model that was used to generate the data. 
The model generating the data may include non-linear predictors and two variable interactions of predictors.
