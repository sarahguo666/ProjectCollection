I learned python in class from two sides

Mathematics:
1) IID random variables
2)Law of Large Numbers
3)Central Limit Theory
4)Linear Regression
5)Markov Chains

Programming: 
1）Use computing tools and techniques to create artifacts
2）Use multiple levels of abstraction, models, and simulation in computation
3）Use algorithms to develop and express solutions to computational problems
