Project Description：

Write a Turtle graphics program that plays the game of Hangman:
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game) The program begins by picking one of the following names of
famous computer scientists at random:
• ALAN TURING
• DONALD KNUTH
• ADA LOVELACE
• GRACE HOPPER
• GORDON MOORE

The player then guesses letters until he/she gets the answer right (and wins) or makes a total of six 
incorrect guesses (and loses). After each incorrect guess, a new body part is drawn: first the head,
then the body, then the left arm, then the right arm, then the left leg and then the right leg: six
incorrect guesses means that the player has lost. The space in each name is not considered part of
the answer – the user needs only to guess the letters.

Use a textinput window to take one letter at a time from the user. The user may enter a lowercase or
uppercase letter as input, but the program should process all letters as uppercase. When the user
guesses a letter correctly, the letter (or letters, if the letter is repeated in the word) should appear over
its correct blank spot(s) in the word. If the user enters multiple letters at a single time, use only the
first letter entered. You may assume that the user enters at least one letter and never enters nonletters.

The entire alphabet should also be drawn on the screen, with guessed letters shown in red, as in the
examples below. If a user guesses the same letter a second time, a new body part should not be
added and the second guess should not be counted against the user.
